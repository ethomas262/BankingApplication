This project involves creating a simple banking system with multiple account types and basic transaction functionality.

### C++ Banking System Project:

#### Project Overview:

Create a console-based banking system that supports multiple account types (e.g., savings, checking) and allows users to perform basic transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

#### Features to Implement:

1\. **Account Types:**

   - Implement multiple account types such as savings and checking.

   - Each account type should have its own interest rate, minimum balance requirement, etc.

2\. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement a simple user authentication system with user accounts.

   - Each user has a unique username and password.

3\. **Account Creation:**

   - Allow users to create different types of accounts.

   - Ensure that usernames are unique.

4\. **Transaction Handling:**

   - Enable users to perform transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

   - Implement appropriate checks, such as ensuring sufficient funds for withdrawals.

5\. **Interest Calculation:**

   - Implement periodic interest calculations based on the account type's interest rate.

6\. **User Interface:**

   - Develop a user-friendly console interface to interact with the banking system.

   - Display account details, transaction history, and other relevant information.

7\. **Persistence:**

   - Implement a simple file-based system to persist user accounts and transaction history.

   - Data should be stored securely.

8\. **Error Handling:**

   - Implement robust error handling to handle various scenarios (e.g., incorrect input, insufficient funds).

9\. **Logging:**

   - Implement logging functionality to record important events and transactions.

10\. **Security Considerations:**

    - Ensure secure handling of user data, including password hashing.

#### Project Structure:

Organize your project into multiple classes to represent different entities (e.g., User, Account, Transaction) and use appropriate data structures.

#### Additional Enhancements (Optional):

Consider adding additional features to make your project even more impressive, such as multi-threading for concurrent transactions, enhanced security measures, or incorporating a graphical library for a more visual interface.

#### Conclusion:

This project will not only showcase your proficiency in C++ but also demonstrate your ability to design and implement a more complex system. Additionally, it allows you to practice various programming concepts, including object-oriented design, file handling, and error handling.

Remember to document your code well, follow best practices, and include a README file explaining how to compile and run your banking system. Good luck with your project!
